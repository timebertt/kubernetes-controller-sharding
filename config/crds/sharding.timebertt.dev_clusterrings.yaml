          ClusterRing declares a virtual ring of sharded controller instances. The specified objects are distributed across
          shards of this ring on the cluster-scope (i.e., objects in all namespaces). Hence, the "Cluster" prefix.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                        These resources are controlled by the controller's main resource, i.e., they have an owner reference with
                        controller=true back to the GroupResource of this RingResource.
                        Typically, the controller also watches objects of this resource and enqueues the owning object (of the main
                        resource) whenever the status of a controlled object changes.
